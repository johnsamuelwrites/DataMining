### Guidelines

1.  To get complete guidance from the mentors, it is highly recommended
    that you work on today\'s practical session and not on the preceding
    ones.
2.  There are several ways to achieve a task. Hence there are many
    possible solutions. But try to make maximum use of the libraries
    that have been suggested to you for your exercises.
